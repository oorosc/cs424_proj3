From 4/12 to 4/18

Worked on creating a chart to display the total roles of each voice actor.

Developed a function to take in a number, the number will dictate which set of 10 Voice Actors to display.  The Voice Actor chart is sorted by appearances.

Worked on testing how to implement the click function for the charts.  As well as finding what kind of data I can pull from the chart.
