<h1 style = 'text-align:center;'>How to use the Parser </h1>
<div id = 'borderama'>
<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
To begin with, the parser contains four query features: <br><br></p>
<p class = 'lead'>
1) <span class = 'loaded'>Scope </span>- The set amount of time we are viewing (All episodes, season x, episode y) <br>
2) <span class = 'loaded'>Filters </span> - The filters we wish to see, meaning characters, writers, directors, etc. that appeared over the scope <br>
3) <span class = 'loaded'>Min/Max slider </span>- The max / min % appearances required to be listed <br>
4) <span class = 'loaded'>And/Or comparison </span> - The sum of your filters with an AND or an OR operator enacted upon them over their scope <br><br>
</p>
<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
To enter a broad category, select the scope or filter, and then click on the button above the respective dropdown. Your selection will automatically be rendered as you choose it. If you wish to add additional filters,
simply click the '+' button to the right of the filter dropdown and it shall be saved until you reset the scope, at which point all your filters will be cleared. Sort alphabetical changes the order of the dropdowns, so
that they're no longer listed by their numerical/parsed order, but rather alphabetically. If you wish to see the results of your parses real time, switch the view away from the character/season explorer and onto the charts
and auto generated table<br>

</p>
</div>      
      		
<h1 style = 'text-align:center;'>Moving through the views </h1>
<div id = 'borderama'>
<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
The starting view of the application is the overview of the top characters across all episodes<br><br></p>
<p class = 'lead'>
* From the overview, each of the cells represent whether or not a character is present(blue) or not present(black) in a particular episode. Hovering over a cell will highlight the cell and show mouse over information about which character and which episode. By clicking on the cell a click panel will open giving the option to switch to a focused view of that character, episode or season.<br>
* Seasons view is very similar to the overview. The difference being that it shows an enlarged view of that particular season. Clicking on a cell will only yield options to go to the specific episode or character.<br>
* Inside the episode view is a listing of the characters, voice actors and locations in the episode. While the full listings will show all that are present, there is also a listing of unique appearances for this particular episode. Clicking on either a character or voice actor name will shift focus to that information.<br>
* Voice actors have a table of showing which episodes they had a role in. The mouse over will show the name of the episode and how many characters this voice actor played. Black cells show that the voice actor was not part of that episode. Clicking on a cell will allow the option to switch to the episode, season and individual options for each unique character by the voice actor. The view also contains an episode listing which can switch the view and a picture of each character that will also switch the links.<br>
* Characters also have a table showing appearances over the series. The pop-ups from mouse clicks will generate links for the episode and season. The names of all episodes a character was in are clickable to shift to episode view as well as voice actors and most common with characters. Clicking on the network map button will produce a 3 tier table showing those who are commonly seen with the character.<br>
* The social network will show characters who share episode appearances. They are broken into 3 tiers based upon a threshold of percentage shared episodes. Each character can be clicked to bring up their social net.<br><br>
